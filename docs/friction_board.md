# HerHealth Hub UX Friction Board

## Patient Flow: Landing â†’ Booking â†’ Payment â†’ Confirmation

### Landing Page Issues
ðŸŸ  **Homepage admin link visible to patients** - "Admin: Create Doctor Invites" link is exposed to all users, breaking professional appearance
*Fix: Hide admin link behind authentication or move to a dedicated /admin route*

ðŸŸ¡ **No clear value proposition hierarchy** - Multiple sections compete for attention without clear prioritization
*Fix: Restructure hero section to lead with primary benefit first*

ðŸŸ¡ **Missing urgency indicators** - No mention of "48-hour booking" promise in hero section
*Fix: Add "Book within 48 hours" as a primary headline element*

### Doctor Selection & Booking Flow
ðŸŸ  **No loading states for ratings** - Rating queries show undefined behavior before loading
*Fix: Show skeleton loaders or default states for ratings during API calls*

ðŸ”´ **Broken slot selection UX** - selectedSlot state not properly synced with form validation
*Fix: Properly integrate slot selection with form state and show clear selected state*

ðŸŸ  **Form validation timing** - Errors appear before user completes input, violating design principles
*Fix: Validate fields only after blur or form submission attempt*

ðŸ”´ **Missing consultation duration** - Booking form shows no duration information, breaking trust
*Fix: Clearly display "20-minute consultation" in booking details*

ðŸŸ  **Phone number confusion** - Optional field but no clear indication why it's needed
*Fix: Add helper text: "Optional - for SMS appointment reminders"*

ðŸŸ¡ **Generic error messages** - API errors don't provide actionable guidance
*Fix: Implement specific error messages for common failure scenarios*

### Payment Flow
ðŸ”´ **No booking summary** - Payment page lacks confirmation of what user is paying for
*Fix: Add booking summary card showing doctor, time, date, and fee breakdown*

ðŸŸ  **Missing payment security indicators** - No SSL/security badges visible during payment
*Fix: Add security badges and encryption indicators near payment form*

ðŸŸ  **Unclear return URL handling** - Payment confirmation redirects to homepage without status
*Fix: Create dedicated confirmation page with booking details*

ðŸ”´ **No payment error recovery** - Failed payments leave user stranded without clear next steps
*Fix: Implement retry flow and clear instructions for payment failures*

### Mobile Experience
ðŸŸ  **Touch targets too small** - Many buttons and links don't meet 44px minimum touch target
*Fix: Increase button sizes and spacing for mobile interface*

ðŸŸ¡ **Form fields cramped** - Booking form feels cluttered on mobile screens
*Fix: Improve spacing and consider multi-step mobile layout*

## Doctor Flow: Invite Link â†’ Onboarding â†’ Slot Creation

### Invite Validation
ðŸŸ¡ **No invite status feedback** - Loading state doesn't indicate what's being checked
*Fix: Add specific "Validating invitation..." message with progress indicator*

ðŸ”´ **Token expiry handling** - Expired invites show generic error without explanation
*Fix: Provide clear messaging about expired invites and contact information*

### Onboarding Flow
ðŸŸ  **Multi-step form without progress indicator** - No way to know completion status
*Fix: Add step progress indicator (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)*

ðŸ”´ **Indemnity checkbox unclear** - Legal requirement buried in form without explanation
*Fix: Highlight indemnity requirement with clear explanation of why it's needed*

ðŸŸ  **Specialty dropdown order** - Options not alphabetized or prioritized by relevance
*Fix: Order specialties by platform relevance (Women's Health, Gynecology first)*

ðŸŸ¡ **Bio field optional but recommended** - No guidance on what makes a good bio
*Fix: Add placeholder text with bio writing tips*

### Slot Management
ðŸŸ  **Slot selection interface confusing** - Time/date grid not intuitive
*Fix: Use calendar-style interface for slot selection*

ðŸ”´ **No minimum slot requirement explained** - Form validation error appears without context
*Fix: Add clear instruction: "Select at least one available time slot to get started"*

ðŸŸ¡ **No slot preview** - Can't see how availability will look to patients
*Fix: Add preview showing patient-facing slot display*

### Completion Flow
ðŸŸ  **No onboarding confirmation email** - Doctors don't receive setup confirmation
*Fix: Send welcome email with dashboard access and next steps*

ðŸ”´ **No dashboard access guidance** - Completed onboarding provides no navigation
*Fix: Provide clear link to doctor dashboard after successful onboarding*

## Cross-Platform Issues

### General UX
ðŸ”´ **Inconsistent error handling** - Different error styles and behaviors across pages
*Fix: Implement unified error handling system with consistent messaging*

ðŸŸ  **No offline state handling** - App breaks with poor connectivity
*Fix: Add offline detection and graceful degradation*

ðŸŸ¡ **Missing accessibility features** - No focus management or screen reader support
*Fix: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support*

### Performance & Loading
ðŸŸ  **No loading states for slow operations** - Payment processing and API calls lack feedback
*Fix: Add loading indicators for all async operations*

ðŸŸ¡ **Heavy JavaScript bundle** - Initial page load could be optimized
*Fix: Implement code splitting for better performance*

### Trust & Security
ðŸ”´ **No data privacy indicators** - Users unclear about data handling during sensitive flows
*Fix: Add privacy assurance messages at key form submission points*

ðŸŸ  **Missing professional credentials display** - Doctor verification status not prominent
*Fix: Add verification badges and credential verification indicators*
